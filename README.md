##Description
This project is a multi-agent AI system designed to automatically generate short, trendy tweets based on the latest AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science news.
Built using Agno (phidata) framework, it leverages Groq's Llama3-70b model, real-time search via DuckDuckGo Tool, and is hosted with FastAPI for scalability and flexibility.

###The system uses a modular multi-agent architecture:

####News Agent: Fetches latest tech articles.

####Tweet Generator Agent: Summarizes articles into viral tweets.

####Team Coordinator Agent: Manages workflow between fetching and tweeting.

The project includes an interactive Agno Playground UI for easy testing and demonstration.
